> **Unofficial project:** AI Usage Dashboard is an independent open-source project. It is not made by, affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or supported by OpenAI. OpenAI and Codex are trademarks of OpenAI; this project only reads local log files from your machine.

AI Usage Dashboard is evolving into AI Usage Tracker. It reads JSONL logs already written by supported local coding agents, indexes aggregate usage counters into SQLite, and gives you a dashboard, CLI, and MCP tools for investigating real usage patterns. It keeps prompts, assistant messages, tool output, pasted secrets, and raw transcript content out of SQLite, CSV exports, and generated dashboard HTML.

Built for developers using local coding agents who want to know which sources, threads, models, subagents, and long chats are driving usage without uploading logs anywhere.

After install, you get a localhost dashboard, a local SQLite aggregate index, CLI reports, MCP tools, and a companion Codex skill for asking questions like "what drove my usage this week?"

## Quick Install

```bash
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
python -m pipx install "git+https://github.com/e1010101/ai-usage-dashboard.git"
ai-usage-dashboard setup
ai-usage-dashboard serve-dashboard --open
```

Use your normal Python launcher for your platform: `python3` is common on macOS/Linux, and `py` may be preferable on Windows. On macOS with Homebrew, `brew install pipx` is also fine.

`setup` installs or refreshes the local Codex plugin wrapper, initializes local config templates when needed, refreshes the aggregate index, runs `ai-usage-dashboard doctor`, and tells you whether Codex needs a restart for plugin discovery.

Want Codex to do it for you? Paste: `Install and configure AI Usage Dashboard from https://github.com/e1010101/ai-usage-dashboard, then run setup and open the dashboard.`

After plugin discovery, Codex can use the companion usage skill to refresh local aggregates, call the MCP tools, and explain usage patterns conversationally. Examples: [MCP And Codex Skills](docs/mcp.md).

If you only want plugin registration after installing the package:

```bash
ai-usage-dashboard install-plugin
```

More install paths: [Install Guide](docs/install.md).

## Platform Support

The core app is not macOS-only. The CLI, SQLite index, dashboard generator, and localhost server are Python-based and CI-tested on Ubuntu for Python 3.10-3.13. It defaults to `~/.codex` for local Codex logs and `~/.codex-usage-tracker` for tracker data; pass `--codex-home` or `--db` when your local layout differs. Codex plugin discovery depends on Codex's local plugin directories on your machine, so run `ai-usage-dashboard doctor` after setup if plugin registration does not appear in Codex.

## Source Support

The tracker is evolving into AI Usage Tracker. The CLI and Codex plugin startup name is `ai-usage-dashboard`; the Python package/distribution name remains `codex-usage-tracker` for compatibility.

- Codex: built-in source, read from `~/.codex/sessions`.
- Claude Code: opt-in source, read from `~/.claude/projects`.
- Hermes: opt-in aggregate source, read from `state.db` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on Windows or `~/.hermes` elsewhere.

Source-refresh commands default to `--source all`. Use `ai-usage-dashboard refresh --source all` to index every supported source, `ai-usage-dashboard refresh --source codex` for Codex only, `ai-usage-dashboard refresh --source claude-code --claude-home ~/.claude` for Claude Code only, or `ai-usage-dashboard refresh --source hermes --hermes-home <path>` for Hermes only. Query and summary views can filter or group by `source_provider` and `source_app`.

## Dashboard Preview

The Calls table is the main investigation surface: filter, sort, inspect details, and export the exact aggregate rows you are looking at.

![Calls view showing filters, totals, the model-call table, and the details panel.](docs/assets/dashboard-calls.png?v=aa16502)

Threads view groups related calls so long chats, subagents, and auto-review passes are easier to reason about as one work session.

![Threads view with one expanded thread and its calls in chronological order.](docs/assets/dashboard-threads.png?v=3cd7338)

The details panel keeps the primary cost, cache, context, allowance, and pricing signals visible before raw identifiers.

![Details panel showing aggregate fields for the selected usage row.](docs/assets/dashboard-details.png?v=84cf6dd)

Insights still gives a fast triage layer for costly threads, low cache reuse, context bloat, and pricing gaps.

![Insights view with ranked Needs Attention cards, investigation presets, and top threads by attention score.](docs/assets/dashboard-insights.png?v=4a40e4f)

The dashboard screenshots use synthetic aggregate fixture data, and the companion prompt and chat previews are synthetic. They do not contain prompts from local logs, assistant responses, tool output, real thread names, real usage totals, or real Codex session content. See the [Dashboard Guide](docs/dashboard-guide.md) for the full walkthrough.

If this helped you track local AI usage, starring the repo helps others find it. Issues and feature requests are welcome.

## Why This Exists

Local coding agents can quietly burn usage through long-running chats, low cache reuse, reasoning spikes, spawned subagents, and auto-review passes. This tool turns the aggregate counters already on your machine into an insight-first dashboard and scriptable local APIs.

Use it to answer:

- Which sources, threads, or models used the most tokens, estimated cost, or Codex credits?
- Are long chats bloating because of accumulated context?
- Which model or reasoning effort is driving usage?
- Are subagents or auto-review passes adding unexpected cost?
- Which calls have low cache reuse, high context pressure, reasoning spikes, or pricing gaps?
- Which projects, project tags, or active directories are consuming the most usage?
- What should Codex inspect next using the companion usage skill?

## Long Chats Can Bloat Fast

Prompt caching helps, but cached input is not the same as no input. Long threads can accumulate a large cached context, and each new turn may still include cached input plus fresh uncached input, output tokens, reasoning output, and tool-related context.

The dashboard makes that pattern visible with:

- `Cached input`
- `Uncached input`
- `Session cumulative`
- `Context use`
- `Cache ratio`

Practical takeaway: when old context is no longer useful, starting a fresh thread can be more efficient than dragging a large cached history forward. That is not a rule for every task, but it is one of the clearest usage patterns the tracker is designed to reveal.

## First Useful Workflow

```bash
ai-usage-dashboard update-pricing
ai-usage-dashboard update-rate-card
ai-usage-dashboard setup
ai-usage-dashboard refresh --source all
ai-usage-dashboard serve-dashboard --source all --open
```

Add `--include-deepseek` to `update-pricing` when you want DeepSeek API model prices and compatibility aliases in the same local pricing cache.

For a Codex-only dashboard, use `--source codex` on `refresh` and `serve-dashboard`.

Then:

1. Leave `Live` enabled while working, or click `Refresh` after a Codex run finishes.
2. Start in `Insights` and scan the `Needs Attention` cards.
3. Use `Time` presets or calendar fields to focus on today, this week, the last 7 days, this month, or a custom range.
4. Use investigation presets for highest-cost threads, highest-credit calls, context bloat, cache misses, pricing gaps, or estimated-price review.
5. Open `Threads` to see how a conversation grew and whether subagent or auto-review work attached to it.
6. Hover or click rows to inspect aggregate fields in `Call Details`.
7. Use `Load context` only when aggregate fields are not enough; context is fetched on demand from the local source JSONL and is not saved into SQLite or the dashboard.

Codex Usage Remaining is read automatically from local Codex JSONL `rate_limits` snapshots when those snapshots are present. Optional manual allowance context is still useful when you want to override a dynamic window, add exact credit totals, or fill in environments without dynamic snapshots:

```bash
ai-usage-dashboard parse-allowance "5h 79% 6:50 PM Weekly 33% Jun 7"
```

The tracker does not call a remote account API or infer your logged-in ChatGPT plan. Manual allowance values in `~/.codex-usage-tracker/allowance.json` take precedence for any window where you provide `remaining_percent`, `remaining_credits`, or `total_credits`; dynamic Codex values fill the rest. Details: [Pricing, Credits, And Allowance](docs/pricing-and-credits.md).

## What It Includes

- Local SQLite index at `~/.codex-usage-tracker/usage.sqlite3`.
- Static dashboard generation plus localhost live refresh.
- `Insights`, `Calls`, and `Threads` dashboard views.
- Source-aware provider/app filters for Codex, Claude Code, and Hermes rows.
- All-history dashboards by default, with an explicit `Active sessions only` toggle for hiding archived sessions.
- CLI summaries, queries, CSV export, dashboard generation, doctor checks, and support bundles.
- MCP tools for Codex sessions that want to query local usage data.
- Companion Codex skills for operational setup and conversational usage analysis.
- Optional local pricing, Codex credit, allowance, threshold, project alias, and privacy-mode configuration.

## Common Commands

```bash
ai-usage-dashboard summary --preset last-7-days
ai-usage-dashboard summary --group-by source_app
ai-usage-dashboard query --source-app claude-code
ai-usage-dashboard query --since 2026-06-01 --min-credits 1
ai-usage-dashboard session <session-id>
ai-usage-dashboard export --output usage.csv
ai-usage-dashboard dashboard --open
ai-usage-dashboard support-bundle --output ~/.codex-usage-tracker/support-bundle.json
```

## Data Privacy

The tracker stores aggregate metrics only: session ids, timestamps, local source paths, source provider/app/format labels, thread labels, cwd/project metadata, model labels, reasoning effort, token counters, pricing/credit annotations, and derived ratios.

It does **not** store prompts, assistant messages, tool output, pasted secrets, raw transcript snippets, or raw context in SQLite, CSV exports, generated dashboard HTML, or synthetic screenshots.

On-demand context loading reads a single original local JSONL file only after an explicit row action, redacts common secret patterns, caps returned text size, and can be disabled with:

```bash
ai-usage-dashboard serve-dashboard --no-context-api --open
```

For shared artifacts, use:

```bash
ai-usage-dashboard --privacy-mode redacted dashboard --open
ai-usage-dashboard --privacy-mode strict export --output usage-redacted.csv
```

## Codex-Assisted Install

Open a Codex session on your machine and paste this:

```text
Install and configure AI Usage Dashboard from https://github.com/e1010101/ai-usage-dashboard.
Use pipx if it is available. If pipx is missing, install it with the platform's Python launcher or use a local virtual environment.
After installation, run ai-usage-dashboard setup and serve-dashboard --open.
Verify the dashboard opens locally and tell me the dashboard URL plus whether I need to restart Codex for plugin discovery.
```

This is optional. The normal shell install above is the fastest trusted path for most users.

## Current Limitations

- This is a sidecar dashboard and plugin, not a native Codex chat overlay.
- Token counts come from each supported source's logged counters; the tracker does not re-tokenize prompts.
- Pricing and Codex credit estimates depend on local rate data and confidence labels. Codex credits apply only to Codex/OpenAI rows; Claude Code and Hermes/DeepSeek rows are marked not applicable for Codex credit calculations.
- Remaining 5-hour and weekly Codex allowance can be read from local Codex `rate_limits` snapshots when present; manual allowance config remains the fallback and override.
- Local logs may not include usage from other agentic surfaces that share the same allowance. Claude Code remaining-usage capture uses an optional local status-line wrapper; Hermes allowance capture is not implemented.
- Parent-child thread relationships are only as good as the metadata each source logs; inferred auto-review attachments are labeled as inferred.

## Roadmap

- Track allowance snapshot history so local Codex credits can be compared against visible remaining-usage changes over time.
- Clarify top-card token accounting by showing output tokens and reasoning output as a subset instead of implying all token cards add together.
- Add more insight presets for cache drift, context growth, subagent-heavy workflows, and pricing/credit confidence gaps.
- Keep the allowance provider boundary ready for an official usage or allowance API if one becomes available.
- Add more source adapters, including Gemini CLI and opencode, behind the same aggregate-only source contract.
- Continue reducing setup friction for pipx installs, local plugin discovery, and Codex companion skill usage.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/e1010101/ai-usage-dashboard.git
cd ai-usage-dashboard
python3 -m venv .venv
