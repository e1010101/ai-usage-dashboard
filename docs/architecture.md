# Architecture

Codex Usage Tracker is a local sidecar app evolving toward AI Usage Tracker. It reads aggregate token counters from supported local coding-agent JSONL logs, stores only aggregate metrics in SQLite, and exposes those metrics through CLI commands, MCP tools, CSV export, and a static or localhost-served dashboard. The package, CLI, and Codex plugin names remain `codex-usage-tracker` for compatibility.

## Boundaries

- `parser.py` is the compatibility facade for source adapters that convert local JSONL events into aggregate `UsageEvent` records. It must not persist prompts, assistant text, tool output, or transcript snippets.
- `adapters/base.py` defines the source-adapter protocol. `adapters/codex_jsonl.py` owns Codex JSONL parsing from `~/.codex/sessions`, and `adapters/claude_code_jsonl.py` owns Claude Code JSONL parsing from `~/.claude/projects`. New sources should add an adapter instead of adding provider-specific logic to store, reports, dashboard, or MCP code.
- `schema.py` owns persisted `usage_events` columns. Add columns there before changing SQLite migrations or export behavior.
- `store.py` owns SQLite setup, refresh, rebuild, and query access. Keep filesystem scanning, database writes, SQL prefilters, counts, limits, and offsets here.
- `reports.py` is the application-service layer for summaries, expensive-call reports, recommendations, pricing coverage, and filtered query payloads. CLI and MCP should call this layer instead of duplicating report assembly.
- `api_payloads.py` owns stable JSON payload helpers shared by CLI and MCP. `json_contracts.py` owns the lightweight contract checks for schema-versioned CLI/MCP payloads. Add payload builders and contract entries together when both surfaces need the same shape.
- `costing.py`, `pricing_config.py`, `pricing_openai.py`, `pricing_estimates.py`, and `allowance.py` own cost, credit, rate-card, and allowance annotation. Keep estimate confidence and source metadata attached to rows. Codex credit estimates are Codex/OpenAI-only; non-Codex rows should be marked not applicable rather than mapped through Codex rate cards.
- `projects.py`, `threads.py`, and `recommendations.py` annotate aggregate rows with project identity, thread relationships, and actionable signals. Project privacy redaction also belongs in `projects.py` so CLI, MCP, dashboard, CSV, and support-bundle surfaces share the same behavior.
- `dashboard.py` builds aggregate-only dashboard payloads and writes HTML/assets. `server.py` adds localhost refresh and explicit lazy context loading.
- `plugin_data/dashboard/dashboard_format.js` owns dashboard formatting primitives. `dashboard_data.js` owns row payload and thread relationship helpers. `dashboard_state.js` owns URL, CSV, and download state utilities. `dashboard.js` owns DOM rendering, event handling, API refresh, and detail-panel behavior.
- `context.py` is the only normal path that reads raw log context, and it does so only for one selected record on demand with redaction and size limits.
- `plugin_installer.py`, `.mcp.json`, `skills/`, and `scripts/check_release.py` own install and packaging behavior.
- `scripts/benchmark_synthetic_history.py` owns generated large-history query timing for 10k, 100k, and 500k aggregate-row fixtures. It must stay synthetic-only and must not read real local source logs.
- `skills/codex-usage-tracker/` is the source copy for the operational Codex skill. It should stay focused on setup, source refresh, dashboard, export, doctor, and direct MCP workflows.
- `skills/codex-usage-api/` is the source copy for the conversational analyst skill. It should stay focused on aggregate-only API routing, source filters, interpretation, and limitations.
- `src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/skills/` contains the wheel-bundled copies installed by `codex-usage-tracker install-plugin`.

## Extension Rules

1. Add new persisted metrics through `UsageEvent`, `schema.py`, migrations, store queries, dashboard payload tests, and CSV/export checks.
2. Add new report views through `reports.py` first, then wire CLI and MCP wrappers to that shared service.
3. Add new machine-readable outputs through `api_payloads.py` or report payload methods with a `schema` value, a `json_contracts.py` entry, and focused tests.
4. Add dashboard-only interactions in `plugin_data/dashboard/dashboard.js` and keep URL state in `dashboard_state.js`.
5. Keep all examples, screenshots, mocks, and tests synthetic. Never derive fixtures from real logs.
6. When editing skill instructions, update both the source `skills/...` file and the bundled `src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/skills/...` copy. `scripts/check_release.py` verifies that installable plugin assets stay complete and synced.
7. When adding fields derived from `cwd`, Git metadata, or source paths, decide how they behave in `normal`, `redacted`, and `strict` privacy modes before exposing them in dashboard, JSON, CSV, MCP, or support-bundle output.

## Validation

Use the narrowest useful check first, then the release suite before committing:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m compileall src
python -m mypy
node --check src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard/dashboard_format.js
node --check src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard/dashboard_data.js
node --check src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard/dashboard.js
node --check src/codex_usage_tracker/plugin_data/dashboard/dashboard_state.js
python scripts/check_release.py
python -m build
python scripts/check_release.py --dist
git diff --check
```

Dashboard UI changes should also be opened in a browser and checked on desktop and mobile widths for overlap, stale state, and aggregate-only output.

Run `python scripts/benchmark_synthetic_history.py --rows 10000 100000 500000` after changing SQLite filters, dashboard payload loading, or indexes.
